Even though modern websites are generally built with user
-friendly interfaces, it's useful to know some basic HTML
. If you know the following 17 HTML example tags (and a few extras), 
you'll be able to create a basic webpage from 
scratch or tweak the code created by an app like WordPress.

We've provided HTML code examples with output for most of the tags. 
If you want to test them for yourself, copy the HTML samples into
 your own document. You can play around with them in a text editor
  and load up your file in a browser to see what your changes do.
